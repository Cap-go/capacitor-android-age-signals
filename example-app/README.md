# Example App for `@capgo/capacitor-android-age-signals`

This Vite playground links directly to the local plugin source so you can exercise the Google Play Age Signals API while iterating on native code.

## Try it out

```bash
bun install
bun run start
```

Use `npx cap add android` inside this directory to create a native shell if you want to test the behaviour on device or emulator. The plugin is Android-only; the iOS project is included for parity but will throw `unimplemented`.
